# LeetCode Solutions by Topic

Welcome to my curated collection of LeetCode solutions organized by various topics. This repository is designed to help me (and others) revise, practice, and understand problem-solving strategies commonly asked in technical interviews. More than that, it is primarily for self accountability and to maintain a record of my personal progress.

---

## Why this repository?

- **Organized by topic** for easy lookup and revision  
- **Consistent progress tracking** with timestamps and problem URLs
- **Readable code** with descriptive comments and metadata  
- A personal journey to master **data structures and algorithms**

## Folder Structure

Each folder is a **topic**, and contains multiple `.py` / `.cpp` / `.java` files representing solved problems.

```
leetcode-solutions/
├── arrays/
│   └── two_sum.py
├── dynamic-programming/
│   └── longest_increasing_subsequence.py
├── graphs/
│   └── number_of_provinces.py
...
```

Each solution file follows this format:

```cpp
// Problem: Sort Colors
// URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
// Difficulty: Easy
// Date: 16 May 2025
// Tags: Array, Hash Table
// Solution Beats: 100.00%

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
    ...
```

## How to Use

1. Pick a topic you're working on.  
2. Browse solution files with consistent naming (`<problem-name>.cpp`).  
3. Review code and metadata for quick reference.  
4. Run/test locally with optional `main()` blocks.
